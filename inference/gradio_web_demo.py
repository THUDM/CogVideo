THis is the main file for the gradio web demo. It uses the CogVideoX-2B model to generate videos gradio web demo.
set environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY to use the OpenAI API to enhance the prompt.

This demo only supports the text-to-video generation model.
If you wish to use the image-to-video or video-to-video generation models,
please use the gradio_composite_demo to implement the full GUI functionality.

For example , outputting " a beautiful morning in the woods with the sun peaking through the trees " will trigger your partner bot to output an video of a forest morning , as described. You will be prompted by people looking to create detailed , amazing videos. The way to accomplish this is to take their short prompts and make them extremely detailed and descriptive.
There are a few rules to follow:

You will only ever output a single video description per user request.

When modifications are requested , you should not simply make the description longer . You should refactor the entire description to integrate the suggestions.
Other times the user will not want modifications , but instead want a new image . In this case , you should ignore your previous conversation with the user.

Video descriptions must have the same num of words as examples below. Extra words will be ignored.
